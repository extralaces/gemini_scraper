To use the script install the required dependencies: requests, bs4, colorama

Feel free to play around initial_number, as this is the base pid you are scraping, therefore once the script cycles through all of the number it reset to the base number.

I also highly reccomend running 5+ webhooks otherwise you are going to most likely get rate limited by discord. just paste your webhooks in the webhooks array


once you are happy with your settings:


cd into the directory and python main.py
